"Employee-Management-System
Employee Management System is a web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, promote, remove, and search employee records. Data is stored using localStorage, ensuring persistence. Features include department summary and easy management without the need for a server or database.

The Employee Management System is a lightweight web-based solution designed for managing employee records efficiently. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this system allows users to seamlessly add, promote, remove, and search employee data. With the use of localStorage, data is persistently stored within the browser, ensuring it remains intact even after a page refresh or browser closure, without requiring a backend server or database.

Key Features
Add Employees
Easily add new employees by inputting their details such as Employee ID, Name, Department, Salary, and Performance Review.

Promote Employees
Update an employee's salary by entering a custom amount. The system ensures that promotions only increase the salary.

Remove Employees
Remove employee records with a simple click, followed by a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletions.

Search Employees
Quickly find employees by searching through their Employee ID, Name, or Department.

Department Summary
Automatically calculates and displays the total number of employees and total salary per department.

Persistent Data
All employee data is stored in the browser using localStorage, ensuring data persistence across sessions without the need for a database.

How It Works
Adding Employees
Users can add employees by entering details like Employee ID, Name, Department, Salary, and Performance Review into the provided form. The added data is instantly displayed in the employee table and saved locally in the browser for future use.

Promoting Employees
The Promote button allows the user to input a new salary for an employee. This updated salary is immediately reflected in the system and persisted in localStorage.

Removing Employees
The Remove button deletes employee records after a confirmation. The employee is removed from the system, and the table updates in real-time.

Searching Employees
Use the search bar to find employees by their ID, name, or department. The table dynamically updates to display only matching results, making it easy to filter through records.

Department Summary
The system automatically calculates the total number of employees in each department and the total salary for that department, providing an overview for department-level management.
